# Prompts

## Assistant

Prompt files in assistant/ are created programmatically from fabric's patterns.

Fabric is a tool created by Daniel Miessler and fabric patterns are authored by fabric contributors.

**Create roles**

To (re-)create prompt files:

```bash
bash create_assistant.sh assistant
```

Pre-commit hooks may trim trailing spaces and empty lines on git commit.

**Add metadata**

Metadata is added to describe prompt tool use etc.

```bash
bash add_metadata.sh assistant
```

If file already starts with metadata section, the file is left intact.

## Developer

Prompt files in developer/ are originally forked from codebase-digest's prompt library.

The codebase-digest and its prompts are created by Kamil Stanuch.

```bash
pip install codebase-digest
```
