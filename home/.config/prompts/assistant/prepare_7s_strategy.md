# OUTPUT
Present your findings as a clean markdown document. Use bullet points for clarity and consistent formatting. Make explicit connections between related elements. Use clear, consistent terminology throughout.

## Style Guidelines:
- Use bullet points for discrete facts
- Expand on significant points with supporting details or examples
- Include specific metrics where available
- Make explicit connections between related elements
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- For key strategic elements, include brief supporting evidence or context
- Keep descriptions clear and precise, but include sufficient detail for meaningful analysis
